Project structure:
    -> use gymnasium for custom snake environment
        -> use pygame for rendering in human mode, potentially try using c++ bindings for the game at some point
    -> use pytorch for agent and training
    -> use tensorboard for training visualisation

Environment:
    -> try different obs spaces (starting from just head pos + target pos to positions of all snake tiles to movement dirs of each tile as a mxnx2 representation, ...)
    -> add simple rewards, experiment with both sparse and other rewards

...

Roadblocks and insights so far:
    - torch import didn't work when installing torch dependencies with conda install -> using pip instead (also use SHELL to ensure use of venv)
    - pip reqs weren't cached correctly due to incorrect order of copying files over (similar problem with python files not being synced)
