Project structure:
    -> use gymnasium for custom snake environment
        -> use pygame for rendering in human mode, potentially try using c++ bindings for the game at some point
    -> use pytorch for agent and training
    -> use tensorboard for training visualisation

Environment:
    -> try different obs spaces (starting from just head pos + target pos to positions of all snake tiles to movement dirs of each tile as a mxnx2 representation, ...)
    -> add simple rewards, experiment with both sparse and other rewards

...

For now just gonna follow the gymnasium documentation on creating a custom environment, starting with adding the wrapper so it can be imported with ease.
